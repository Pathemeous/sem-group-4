# Bubble Trouble [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Pathemeous/sem-group-4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Pathemeous/sem-group-4)
A java clone of the game "Bubble Trouble". <br />
Made by Group 4 for the course Software Engineering Methods 2015-2016.

## Starting the game
To guarentee that the game will run properly, use the following Maven build goals:

<code>package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=nl.tudelft.semgroup4.MainApp</code>

This will ensure that all natives are downloaded properly.

## Tests
Due to the nature of our GUI and Travis not supporting this, the tests are currently not in the working copy.
The tests are performed at a testing branch, which is up to date with the working copy.

Please refer to the tag 'working-copy-tests' for this branch.
